# RELAY

*Open-source backend infrastructure for multiplayer games, including matchmaking, lobbies, server browsers, and hosting tools for Unity.*

Do you want to develop **multiplayer** games and **social experiences** like for example Fall Guys or Among Us?

Well I wanted to solve that, **RELAY** is an entire **multiplayer infrastructure and dev-tool integration with Unity** that can be self-hosted or deployed to production-grade scalability in the cloud and lets you focus on expressing your social experiences and gameplay ideas.

## Key Features

- **Easy to use**: Abstracts the technical and messy networking details away so you'll be building your game in Unity and not dealing with external tools!
- **Matchmaking**: Supports highly configurable modern "Fall guys" style matchmaking as well as the good old conventional server browser UI.
- **Player services**: Let your players save their character customizations, earn points, generate statistics, send friend requests and jump into matches together.
